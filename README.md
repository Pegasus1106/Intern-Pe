# Project 1:
Scientific Calculator:
The Python scientific calculator is a powerful tool designed to perform complex mathematical calculations and solve scientific problems. It leverages the capabilities of the Python programming language, providing an extensive set of mathematical functions and operations.

With the scientific calculator, users can perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it offers advanced functionalities such as exponentiation, logarithms, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), square roots, and factorial calculations.

# Project 2:
Digital Clock:
The Python digital clock is a simple program that displays the current time in a digital format. It utilizes the capabilities of the Python programming language to retrieve the system time and update the display accordingly.

The digital clock typically presents the time in hours, minutes, and seconds format, using digits to represent each component. It can also include additional features such as displaying the date, showing the time in 12-hour or 24-hour format, and updating the time continuously.

The digital clock is a useful tool for displaying the current time on a computer screen. It is commonly used in various applications, such as desktop widgets, screensavers, or as a component in larger programs. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for implementing time-related features in Python projects.
